    "## **Categories of Object Detection Models**\n",
    "1. **Two-Stage Detectors**  \n",
    "   - **Process:** Detect region proposals first, then refine them in a second stage.\n",
    "   - **Examples:** R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** High accuracy\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Slower inference speed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single-Stage Detectors**  \n",
    "   - **Process:** Directly predict bounding boxes and classes in one pass.\n",
    "   - **Examples:** YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** Faster inference\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Slight trade-off in accuracy compared to two-stage detectors\n",

    "### 1. **R-CNN (Region-Based CNN)**  \n",
    "- **Developed by:** Ross Girshick (2014)  \n",
    "- **Architecture:**  \n",
    "  1. Extract region proposals using Selective Search.  \n",
    "  2. Pass proposals through a CNN for classification and bounding box regression.  \n",
    "- **Limitation:** Slow; requires multiple CNN evaluations per image.  \n",
    "- **Improved Versions:** Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Fast R-CNN**  \n",
    "- **Improvement Over:** R-CNN  \n",
    "- **Key Feature:** Uses a single CNN for feature extraction; region proposals are classified using these shared features.  \n",
    "- **Advantage:** Faster than R-CNN but still bottlenecked by region proposal generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Faster R-CNN**  \n",
    "- **Developed by:** Shaoqing Ren et al. (2015)  \n",
    "- **Architecture:**  \n",
    "  - Introduced the **Region Proposal Network (RPN)** to generate proposals inside the network itself.  \n",
    "- **Key Feature:** End-to-end trainable; high accuracy for many applications.  \n",
    "- **Limitation:** Slower than single-stage detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  \n",
    "- **Developed by:** Joseph Redmon et al.  \n",
    "- **Versions:** YOLOv1 to YOLOv8  \n",
    "- **Architecture:**  \n",
    "  - Divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities in one pass.  \n",
    "- **Key Feature:** Extremely fast, suitable for real-time applications.  \n",
    "- **Improvement:** Later versions (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8) include better backbone networks for improved accuracy.  \n",
    "- **Use Case:** Drones, autonomous vehicles, surveillance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 5. **SSD (Single Shot Detector)**  \n",
    "- **Developed by:** Wei Liu et al. (2016)  \n",
    "- **Architecture:**  \n",
    "  - Uses multiple feature maps to detect objects at different scales.  \n",
    "- **Key Feature:** Faster than Faster R-CNN and supports multiple aspect ratios.  \n",
    "- **Limitation:** Less accurate than Faster R-CNN but still useful for real-time detection.  \n",
    "- **Variants:** SSD300, SSD512\n",

    "### 6. **RetinaNet**   (feature pyramid)\n",
    "- **Developed by:** Facebook AI Research (2017)  \n",
    "- **Architecture:**  \n",
    "  - Introduced **Focal Loss** to handle class imbalance (important for detecting small objects).  \n",
    "- **Key Feature:** Balances accuracy and speed.  \n",

    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Stage Models** (e.g., Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN) are highly accurate but slower.\n",
    "- **Single-Stage Models** (e.g., YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet) prioritize speed and are suitable for real-time applications.\n",
    "- **New Architectures** (e.g., DETR) leverage transformers and can outperform CNN-based models in some tasks but require more data and computation.\n",
    "- **Specialized Models** (e.g., Mask R-CNN) go beyond object detection to perform tasks like segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object detection model has strengths suited to specific tasks, making it essential to select the right one based on your application’s requirements—whether it’s real-time speed, high accuracy, or advanced features like segmentation."
