    "### **Image Segmentation in OpenCV**\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple meaningful regions, such as **foreground and background**. Two common algorithms in OpenCV are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Watershed Algorithm** – Good for separating touching objects.\n",
    "2. **GrabCut Algorithm** – Useful for foreground extraction (like removing backgrounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Watershed Algorithm: Segment Touching Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **watershed algorithm** treats pixel intensities as topography and \"floods\" the regions to perform segmentation. It's particularly effective in separating overlapping objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Code Example: Watershed Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cv2\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Load and preprocess the image\n",
    "image = cv2.imread('coins.jpg')\n",
    "gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n",
    "_, binary = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Noise removal using morphological operations\n",
    "kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)\n",
    "opening = cv2.morphologyEx(binary, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel, iterations=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Identify sure background and sure foreground areas\n",
    "sure_bg = cv2.dilate(opening, kernel, iterations=3)\n",
    "dist_transform = cv2.distanceTransform(opening, cv2.DIST_L2, 5)\n",
    "_, sure_fg = cv2.threshold(dist_transform, 0.7 * dist_transform.max(), 255, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Identify unknown regions\n",
    "sure_fg = np.uint8(sure_fg)\n",
    "unknown = cv2.subtract(sure_bg, sure_fg)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Label the markers and apply watershed\n",
    "_, markers = cv2.connectedComponents(sure_fg)\n",
    "markers = markers + 1  # Ensure background is not zero\n",
    "markers[unknown == 255] = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 6: Apply the watershed algorithm\n",
    "markers = cv2.watershed(image, markers)\n",
    "image[markers == -1] = [0, 0, 255]  # Mark boundaries with red\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 7: Display the segmented result\n",
    "cv2.imshow('Watershed Segmentation', image)\n",
    "cv2.waitKey(0)\n",
    "cv2.destroyAllWindows()\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **Thresholding**: Use **Otsu’s method** to binarize the image.\n",
    "2. **Morphological operations**: Remove small noise and separate connected objects.\n",
    "3. **Distance transform**: Helps identify **foreground regions**.\n",
    "4. **Watershed**: The algorithm assigns markers to regions and identifies boundaries by \"flooding.\"\n",

    "## **2. GrabCut Algorithm: Foreground Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **GrabCut algorithm** segments the foreground from the background based on user input (like an initial bounding box).\n",

    "mask2 = np.where((mask == 2) | (mask == 0), 0, 1).astype('uint8')\n",
    "result = image * mask2[:, :, np.newaxis]\n",

    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **Define a bounding box** around the object to extract.\n",
