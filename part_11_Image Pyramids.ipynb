    "1. **Gaussian Pyramid**:  \n",
    "   - Images are repeatedly blurred and downsampled to generate smaller versions (like a pyramid).  \n",
    "   - **`pyrDown()`** reduces the image size by half at each level.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Load the original image\n",
    "image = cv2.imread('sample.jpg')\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **`pyrDown()`** reduces the image dimensions by **half** at each call.  \n",
    "   - If the original size is `(512x512)`, the smaller image will be `(256x256)`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`pyrUp()`** doubles the dimensions of the image.  \n",
    "   - If applied to a `(256x256)` image, the result will be `(512x512)`. \n",
    "   - **Note:** Scaling up might lead to a **blurry image** since some information is lost during the downscaling.\n",

    "- **Image reconstruction**: Use Laplacian pyramids for reconstructing images from smaller levels.\n",
