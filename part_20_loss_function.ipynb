    "### **Why Do We Need a Loss Function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning and deep learning, a **loss function** is used to measure the difference between the predicted output and the actual (ground truth) value. The goal of training is to minimize this difference, so the model can make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Guides Model Training:** The loss function gives feedback on how well (or poorly) the model is performing, helping it adjust its parameters (weights) during training through **gradient descent**.\n",
    "2. **Optimization Objective:** It quantifies the error so the optimization algorithm knows how to modify the model to reduce the error.\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Metric:** It ensures the model focuses on the right objectives—such as correctly predicting class labels in classification tasks.\n",
