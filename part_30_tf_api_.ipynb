    "In TensorFlow’s **Keras** library, both the **Sequential API** and **Functional API** are used to build deep learning models. However, they have **different use cases, flexibility, and design approaches**. Let’s explore the key differences between them.\n",

    "## 1. **Sequential API**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Sequential API** is the simplest way to build a model by stacking layers **one after another** in a linear flow. It’s ideal for models where each layer has **exactly one input and one output**, like a simple feedforward neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Sequential API Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build a sequential model\n",
    "model = Sequential([\n",
    "    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),\n",
    "    Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n",
    "])\n",

    "# Display the model summary\n",
    "model.summary()\n",

    "- When the model architecture is **simple** and **linear** (layer-by-layer flow).\n",
    "- No layer requires **multiple inputs or multiple outputs**.\n",
    "- **Quick prototyping** of straightforward models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations:**\n",
    "- It only supports models with **one input** and **one output path**.\n",
    "- Does not allow for more complex architectures like **multi-input or multi-output models**.\n",
    "- Difficult to build models with **non-linear connections** (e.g., residual connections or shared layers).\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. **Functional API**\n",

    "The **Functional API** offers **more flexibility** than the Sequential API and allows building **non-linear models**. It’s designed for **complex architectures** where:\n",
    "- Layers can have **multiple inputs or outputs**.\n",
    "- Layers can be **reused** in different parts of the model.\n",
    "- You can create models with **skip connections, shared layers, or branches** (e.g., ResNet, Siamese networks).\n",
