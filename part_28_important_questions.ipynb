    " **tradeoff between bias and variance** refers to the challenge of balancing two competing sources of error when building machine learning models. Here’s the essence of this tradeoff:\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Simple Terms**  \n",
    "- **Bias**: Error from the model being too simple to capture the underlying patterns (underfitting).  \n",

    "### **Examples of the Tradeoff**\n",

    "   - The model is too simple (e.g., a linear model for non-linear data).\n",
    "   - It consistently gives poor predictions.\n",
    "   - Training and test errors are both high.\n",

    "3. **Ensemble Methods**: Techniques like Bagging and Boosting help control bias and variance.\n",
