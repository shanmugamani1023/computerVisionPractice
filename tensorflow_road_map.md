The time required to complete the TensorFlow roadmap depends on your prior knowledge, pace, and daily commitment. Below is an **estimated time breakdown** for each phase based on average learning speed:

| **Phase** | **Estimated Duration** | **Daily Commitment** | **Total Time** |
|------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Phase 1: Basics of TensorFlow and Python Setup** | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 hours/day | ~10-14 hours |
| **Phase 2: Core ML Models with TensorFlow** | 2-3 weeks | 1-2 hours/day | ~20-30 hours |
| **Phase 3: Computer Vision with TensorFlow** | 2-4 weeks | 1-2 hours/day | ~30-40 hours |
| **Phase 4: NLP with TensorFlow** | 2-4 weeks | 1-2 hours/day | ~30-40 hours |
| **Phase 5: Deployment with TensorFlow Lite & TF.js** | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 hours/day | ~10-15 hours |
| **Phase 6: Advanced Topics (GANs, RL, Custom Loops)** | 2-4 weeks | 1-2 hours/day | ~30-40 hours |
| **Phase 7: Real-World Projects & Practice** | Ongoing | 1-2 hours/day | Continuous |

### **Total Estimated Time**  
If followed sequentially, **the entire roadmap will take around 3 to 5 months**, assuming:  
- **Daily practice** of 1-2 hours.
- Time for breaks and revision.
  
---

### **Faster Pace (Crash Learning Plan)**  
If you’re highly motivated and want to learn faster, you could:  
- Study **3-4 hours per day**.
- Complete the roadmap in **1.5 to 2 months**.

---

### **Adjustments Based on Experience**  
- **If you already know Python and ML basics**: You can skip parts of Phases 1 and 2, reducing 2-3 weeks from the total time.
- **If TensorFlow is entirely new to you**: Stick to 1-2 hours per day to avoid burnout and ensure deeper understanding.
