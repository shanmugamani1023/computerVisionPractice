    "Segmentation is a computer vision task that involves dividing an image into meaningful regions, such as objects or background, by labeling each pixel. Unlike object detection, which draws bounding boxes around objects, segmentation provides **pixel-level classification**. There are different types and models for segmentation, depending on the task requirements.  \n",

    "## **Types of Segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Segmentation:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Classify each pixel into a class (e.g., all cars belong to one class \"car\").  \n",
    "   - **Example:** Labeling every pixel as \"sky,\" \"road,\" or \"car.\"\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Doesn't distinguish between individual instances of the same object (e.g., two cars will both be labeled as \"car\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Segmentation:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Not only classifies pixels but also identifies individual instances of objects.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Distinguishing between two separate cars, even though both belong to the same \"car\" class.  \n",
    "   - **Popular Models:** Mask R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Panoptic Segmentation:**  \n",
    "   - **Goal:** Combines semantic and instance segmentation by classifying every pixel and assigning a unique ID to each instance.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Identifying \"car 1,\" \"car 2,\" and the \"road\" pixels separately.  \n",
