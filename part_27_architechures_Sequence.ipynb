    "**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are a class of artificial neural networks designed for processing sequential data by capturing dependencies across time steps. Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs maintain a **hidden state** that allows them to store information from previous time steps, making them suitable for tasks like time-series forecasting, language modeling, and speech recognition. Below is an overview of RNNs, their types, and applications.\n",

    "## **How RNNs Work**\n",
    "- **Input:** A sequence of data points (e.g., words in a sentence, time-series data).\n",
    "- **Hidden State:** Maintains memory of previous time steps, allowing information to flow across the sequence.\n",
    "- **Output:** Predictions or classifications at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step \\(t\\):\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "h_t = f(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- \\(h_t\\): Hidden state at time \\(t\\).  \n",
